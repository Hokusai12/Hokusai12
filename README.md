### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Hokusai12/Hokusai12** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on
    A Dungeons & Dragons site for creating and storing world assets
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    Full-Stack Development using Java with Spring Boot
- 📫 How to reach me: 
    Email: hokusai2003@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
    When I'm not torturing myself with a computer💻 I like to practice whatever piano piece I'm working on at the moment.🎹
    If not those, then I'm most likely lost in an video game with no way out 🎮🔦
